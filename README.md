# PORTFOLIO
Personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and contact information.

Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository!

This project is a modern, responsive web application designed to showcase my professional skills, projects, and experience as a software developer. It serves as both an introduction to who I am and a central hub for all my work.

The portfolio includes:

🧠 A brief about me and what I do

💻 A featured section highlighting my top projects

🛠 A list of technologies and tools I work with

📄 A downloadable resume

✉️ A contact form to get in touch

Built with a clean and minimal design to provide a smooth and engaging user experience across all devices.

Would you like me to include a full sample README.md with setup instructions, technologies, and features too?
